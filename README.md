## Tiv-Bible

![Build, Lint & Test CI](https://github.com/IniongunIsaac/Tiv-Bible/workflows/Build,%20Lint%20&%20Test%20CI/badge.svg) <br>

An Android Holy Bible application (in TIV language) developed using Kotlin, MVVM with repository pattern, LiveData, ViewModel, Rx, Dagger2, Room, Material Design, Navigation Components, Data Binding and some other libraries from Android Jetpack.
The application uses Room extensively for offline storage which ensures that content is delivered to users fast and without delays. The following are the features of the app:

##### Authentication:
Users can sign in using their email and password or sign up for a free account with a formal name, email and password. Users are optionally required to verify their phone number using SMS verification.

##### Light and Dark Mode:
The app deploys a really simple, intuitive yet sophisticated user interface to give you
great experience. To this effect, the app allows you to dynamically switch between light and dark modes while going through its content.

##### Share and Copy:
The app allows you to make a selection of verses and either share with other via media such as Email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, Instagram etc etc. The selected verses text can also be copied for later usage in other apps.

##### Bookmarks:
The app allows you to select one or more verses and add them to your bookmarks for later usage. This feature makes it easy for you to reference verses for later usage while using reading through the bible. Your list of bookmarks can be viewed at a later time and you can then decide to share, copy or delete them respectively.

##### Highlights:
The app allows you to select and highlight verses using one of several colors provided by the app. This makes it easy for you to lay emphasis on certain verses as you read through and as you receive more insight and revelation. Your list of highlights with color indications for each highlight can be viewed at a later time and you can then decide to share, copy or delete them respectively.

##### Notes:
While reading the bible, the app allows you to take notes for any selected verses of your choice. A list of verses with comments alongside them can be viewed at a later time and you can then decide to share them, copy or delete them respectively.

##### Search and History
The app contains a robust functionality that allows you to search through the entire bible. Upon successful search, a list of search results is displayed and you can choose to proceed with reading the full chapter or verse of any of the search results. In addition to this, you can also find lists of your recent searches and reading history respectively.

##### Custom Settings
The app allows you to dynamically:
* Change the default font to any of the font styles provided to suit your taste.
* Increase or decrease the font size of text while reading.
* Increase or decrease the spacing between the lines of text while you read.
* Ensure that the device remain awake while you read the bible.
